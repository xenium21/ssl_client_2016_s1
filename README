CITS3002 Project - Oldtrusty client
Author: Noah Macri (21315211)

Implemented in C

Compiled on:
	RHEL 7 - UWA Computer Labs
	Debian 8.4 (gcc 4.9.2, openssl 1.0.1k)

Operation:
	Use the supplied Makefile to compile the client.

	Only one command is allowed in the arguments supplied (add, fetch, list, vouch).

	Client and error logs are dumped to the file: log

	Listing and fetching both output to the stdout stream.
	So piping the fetch is important.

	Certificates must be placed in the working directory of the client, and not in a folder.

	Certificates must be in the PEM format.

Commands:
	Add
	./oldtrusty -u client.pem -h ipv4:port -a file

	Fetch
	./oldtrusty -u client.pem -h ipv4:port -f file -c number* -n name*

	List
	./oldtrusty -u client.pem -h ipv4:port -l

	Vouch
	./oldtrusty -u client.pem -h ipv4:port -v filename vouch.pem
	
	*Denotes optional commands

Known errors:
	Issuing a certificate that does not exist may cause a segmentation fault.
